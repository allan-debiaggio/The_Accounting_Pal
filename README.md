# The Accounting Pal
  
Just a little program to help with accounting.  
A few implementations to do :

- Nice display and menu
- User can choose between simple calculator or automated accounting
- Automated accounting takes rents, loans, food, car, subscriptions and other expenses to calculate the total remaining per month and long term
- User can create new lists as well
- Saved profiles option

## Second version : .exe with graphical interface
